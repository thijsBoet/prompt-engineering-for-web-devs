# Prompt Engineering for Web Developers

## 1. What is Prompt Engineering?

- Crafting prompts to effectively guide a language model's responses.
- Designing and refining inputs to obtain desired outputs.
- The Art of getting AI to do what you want.

## 2. Effective Prompting

- Be Specific
- Use Technical Terms
- Provide Context
- Give Examples
- Iterate!

## 3. Writing Effective Prompts

**1. Be Specific*
---
   -:x: "How do I center something?".<br>
   -:white_check_mark: "How do I center an element on a webpage?".<br>
   -:white_check_mark: "What's the best way to center a div element horizontally and vertically using CSS?".<br>
       **Possible --flag option**.<br>
   -"Assume I'm a beginning/medior/senior developer".<br>
   -"Do not use the typical 'Hello World' example".<br>
   -"Give an example in TypeScript and explain each line of code in the most simple and accessible way".<br>

**2. Use Technical terms**
---
   -:x: "How do I create a form?".<br>
   -:white_check_mark: "Create a form in *Javascript* with one input that accepts a *string* and on submit prints that word to the webpage in reverse".   <br>
   -:x: "Show me an React component"<br>
   -:white_check_mark: "Show me a *functional react component* with an atypical example of the useEffect hook".<br>

**3. Provide Context**
---
   -:x: "I want my website to look good on phones".<br>
   -:white_check_mark: "What are the recommended CSS media queries for *mobile, tablet and desktop views* to ensure my website looks good across    devices".<br>

## 4. Control the length and format of responses

### Examples
   -Give me a *brief 2-step explanation* of creating custom JavaScript event.<br>
   -Compare CSS Grid and Flexbox, *highlighting their main differences and use cases in a tabular format*.<br>
   -Please *summarize in 3 bullet points* why innerHTML should be avoided.<br>
   -List the *five most important JavaScript concepts* a beginning developer should be comfortable with before learning React.<br>
   -Create a *flowchart describing how to submit a pull request using Github*.<br>
   -Create *pseudo code in the form of code comments* describing how I can write a *React component* that displays the *time in a user's local   timezone*.<br>
