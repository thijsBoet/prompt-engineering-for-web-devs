    **Possible --flag option**
   - "Assume I'm a beginning/medior/senior developer"
   - "No not use the typical 'Hello World' example"
   - "Give an example in TypeScript and explain each line of code in the most simple and accessible way"

2. Use Technical terms
   - :x: "How do I create a form?"
   - :white_check_mark: "Create a form in Javascript with one input that accepts a string and on submit prints that word to the webpage in reverse"
   
   - :x: "Show me an React component"
