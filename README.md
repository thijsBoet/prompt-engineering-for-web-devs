# Prompt Engineering for Web Developers

## 1. What is Prompt Engineering?

- Crafting prompts to effectively guide a language model's responses.
- Designing and refining inputs to obtain desired outputs.
- The Art of getting AI to do what you want.

## 2. Effective Prompting

- Be Specific
- Use Technical Terms
- Provide Context
- Give Examples
- Iterate!

## 3. Writing Effective Prompts

#### 1. Be Specific
:x: "How do I center something?".
:white_check_mark: "How do I center an element on a webpage?".
:white_check_mark: "What's the best way to center a div element horizontally and vertically using CSS?".
    **Possible --flag option**.
"Assume I'm a beginning/medior/senior developer".
"Do not use the typical 'Hello World' example".
"Give an example in TypeScript and explain each line of code in the most simple and accessible way".

#### 2. Use Technical terms
:x: "How do I create a form?".
:white_check_mark: "Create a form in *Javascript* with one input that accepts a *string* and on submit prints that word to the webpage in reverse".
:x: "Show me an React component"
:white_check_mark: "Show me a *functional react component* with an atypical example of the useEffect hook".

#### 3. Provide Context
:x: "I want my website to look good on phones".
:white_check_mark: "What are the recommended CSS media queries for *mobile, tablet and desktop views* to ensure my website looks good across devices".

## 4. Control the length and format of responses

### Examples
Give me a *brief 2-step explanation* of creating custom JavaScript event.
Compare CSS Grid and Flexbox, *highlighting their main differences and use cases in a tabular format*.
Please *summarize in 3 bullet points* why innerHTML should be avoided.
List the *five most important JavaScript concepts* a beginning developer should be comfortable with before learning React.
Create a *flowchart describing how to submit a pull request using Github*.
Create *pseudo code in the form of code comments* describing how I can write a *React component* that displays the *time in a user's local timezone*.
