# Prompt Engineering for Web Developers

## 1. What is Prompt Engineering?

- Crafting prompts to effectively guide a language model's responses.
- Designing and refining inputs to obtain desired outputs.
- The Art of getting AI to do what you want.

## 2. Effective Prompting

- Be Specific
- Use Technical Terms
- Provide Context
- Give Examples
- Iterate!

## 3. Writing Effective Prompts

1. Be Specific
- :x: "How do I center something?"
- :white_check_mark: "How do I center an element on a webpage?"
- :white_check_mark: "What's the best way to center a div element horizontally and vertically using CSS?"
 **Possible --flag option**
- "Assume I'm a beginning/medior/senior developer"
- "Do not use the typical 'Hello World' example"
- "Give an example in TypeScript and explain each line of code in the most simple and accessible way"

1. Use Technical terms
- :x: "How do I create a form?"
- :white_check_mark: "Create a form in **Javascript** with one input that accepts a **string** and on submit prints that word to the webpage in reverse"
- :x: "Show me an React component"
- :white_check_mark: "Show me a **functional react component** with an atypical example of the useEffect hook"

1. Provide Context
- :x: "I want my website to look good on phones"
- :white_check_mark: "What are the recommended CSS media queries for **mobile, tablet and desktop views** to ensure my website looks good across devices"

## 4. Control the length and format of responses

### Examples
 - Give me a **brief 2-step explanation** of creating custom JavaScript event.
 - Compare CSS Grid and Flexbox, **highlighting their main differences and use cases in a tabular format.**
 - Please **summarize in 3 bullet points** why innerHTML should be avoided.
 - List the **five most important JavaScript concepts** a beginning developer should be comfortable with before learning React
 - Create a **flowchart describing how to submit a pull request using Github**
 - Create **pseudo code in the form of code comments** describing how I can write a **React component** that displays the **time in a user's local timezone**
